# Codes for Psychological Data
In this repository, I included some functions and pipelines useful for analyzing psychological data.

 * In the folder `analyses_Python` there are some codes for data wrangling and Structural Equation Modeling with `pandas` and `semopy` (the script also includes some useful links), respectively.
 * In the folder `analyses_R` there are some codes and customized functions to (a) manage composite scores and (b) compute reliability indexes using the `tidyverse` ecosystem. This code can also be adpted for other purposes.
 * The file `PythonResources.md` has some links related to Python.
