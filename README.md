# Codes for Psychological Data
In this repository, I included some functions and pipeline useful for analyzing psychological data.

 * In the folder `analyses_Python` there are some codes for data wrnagling and Structural Equation Modeling with `semopy` (the script also include some useful links)
 * In the folder `analyses_R` there are some codes and customized functions to manage and compute reliability indexes using the `tidyverse` ecosystem. This code can also be adpted for other purposes.
 * The file `PythonResources.md` has some links usfeul to learn Python.
